# [D&D 5e Wizard](link-to-5e-wizard)

D&D 5e Wizard is a web application which helps new and experienced players play the game. By uploading their character sheet from a lightweight, automated spreadsheet format, the application interfaces with a database containing spell information, weapon information, and a large amount of the 5e rulebook.

This enables automatic rolling for skills and saving throws, as well as spell and weapon information popups and custom dice rolls using d20 syntax.

Currently does not allow characters to be accessed from database; character sheets must be uploaded every time to access the character information.
Limited support for multiclassing.
